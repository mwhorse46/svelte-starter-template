## Command

- npm start

  > Run the development server. This command creates a path accessible through HTTP and HTTPS. HTTP is applied with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). HTTPS has a built-in certificate for testing.

- npm run build

  > Generate production build results. Minify is applied to the result and hmr is excluded.

- npm run watch

  > Same as the npm start command, but does not serve the code with HTTP and HTTPS.

- npm run clean

  > This command deletes all files in the 'dist' folder. However, the folder below the list is not deleted. If there is a static resource that should not be deleted, create a folder in the folder and use it.
